## About me
**Description**: Here's a quick look into all-things-Marjorie:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning how to use GitHub to document my coding journey. As a digital marketer, I am also trying to become more proficient in SEO and Content Strategy so I'm also working to complete a couple of Hubspot certifications. Lastly, I am trying to become more comfortable with Procreate to start one of my dreams of animating. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS. Javascript will be next!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d like to get my hands dirty with a few simple open source contributions. Feel free to suggest a few projects!
- ðŸ“« Feel free to follow me on LinkedIn: www.linkedin/in/marjoriefreeman
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am mildly obsessed with black widows.
